# Spring Time in Kotlin, Episode 1: Getting Started

This is a demo project used in [the first episode of Spring Time in Kotlin series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf-kjD2ZmZk) at the official [Kotlin YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7uiEZIqci43m22KDl0sNw).

In this demo, you will find how to create a simple REST API using Spring Boot and storing the data by adding an [H2 database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) for simple in-memory storage (which later can be easily switched out for an actual relational/SQL database for persistent storage).
